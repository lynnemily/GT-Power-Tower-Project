Automating Data for the Power Tower

The Power Tower is a swimming apparatus that is manually set up with no way to record data. Our team devised a plan to capture the data using an app on the swimmer's phone and translating it to a dashboard set by the coach. The coach is able to set up workouts for the swimmers and see the data in real time. The data points caputured are distance swam, time, weight and counted strokes.
